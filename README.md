# 🚀 Smart Spacecraft Inventory Manager

An intelligent inventory management system designed specifically for organizing items within spacecraft containers. This app enables seamless item tracking, optimal spatial arrangement, and smarter long-term storage — all through an interactive interface powered by React and Python.

## 🌟 Overview

Managing space aboard a spacecraft is no small task. Our application simplifies it by allowing astronauts or mission operators to:

- Upload item and container data
- Automatically place items optimally into containers
- Visualize placements in a user-friendly layout
- Make decisions based on expiry, usage limits, and priority

It’s not just about fitting boxes in space — it’s about sustainability, accessibility, and long-term mission success.
