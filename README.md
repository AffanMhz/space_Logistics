# 🚀 Spacecraft Inventory Manager

An intelligent inventory and storage management system designed for spacecrafts and space missions. This application helps you manage containers and items, auto-place them efficiently based on space constraints, and prioritize critical resources — all through an intuitive interface and smart backend logic.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- 📦 **Manages Containers**: Create and manage containers with defined 3D dimensions.
- 📋 **Manages Items**: Upload items with properties like dimensions, priority, expiry date, usage limits, and preferred zones.
- 🤖 **Auto-Placement Algorithm**: Automatically fits items into the best possible container, optimizing for space, accessibility, and long-term utility.
- 📊 **Interactive UI**: A React frontend to upload CSVs, view placement results, and explore containers and their contents.
- 🔁 **Smart Replacements**: Keeps track of item expiry and usage limits for dynamic updates.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- **CSV Uploads**: Upload a list of items and containers via clean CSV formats.
- **Custom Parameters**: Every item can have:
  - `ID`, `Name`
  - `Width`, `Depth`, `Height` (rotatable)
  - `Priority (0–100)`
  - `Expiry Date`, `Usage Limit`
  - `Preferred Zone` (optional)
- **Optimized Placement**:
  - High-priority items are more accessible.
  - Expiring items are placed where they’re easy to remove.
  - Minimal reshuffling of existing items.
- **Modular**:
  - Backend handles logic and validation.
  - Frontend stays responsive and user-friendly.
